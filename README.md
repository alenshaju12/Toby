3D print the components:
base.stl-1
gapper.stl-16
leg 1.2.stl-4
leg2.stl-2
leg3.stl-2

8 servo motors
raspberrypi zero w
PCA9685 servo controller

uploade ubentu to an sd card and start up the raspberry pi zero.
go to desktop folder and 
clone the https://github.com/alenshaju12/TobyRaspberrypi.git repository 

connect the servos to the servo driver and then run the servo.py scrypt in raspberry pi and then make the servos to then 90 degree angle then assemble the legs as shown in the picture
